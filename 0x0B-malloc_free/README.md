Why and when use malloc

How to use valgrind to check for memory leak.

## Requirements:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc and free. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, real
loc etc is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You dont have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it wont be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don
t have to push them to your repo (if you do we wont take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compil
ation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called holberton.h

Dont forget to push your header file
